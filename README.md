### **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**
Click the moon/sun icon in the header to switch between the light and dark themes. This change is applied globally to the header, footer, and content areas.

### **Subscription Form**
Users can enter their email in the subscription form. You can integrate this form with services like **Mailchimp** or connect it to a backend for further functionality.
